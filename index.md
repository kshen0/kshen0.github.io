# THANKSGIVING SPECIAL

We've joined forces with peerless baker **Cat Reading Kamireddy** to benefit [SF New Deal](https://sfnewdeal.org/) this Thanksgiving. All proceeds from Thanksgiving sales will go to SF New Deal to help pay restaurants to provide meals for food insecure neighbors.

## Home on the range cookies
$5/3

A classic chocolate chip cookie with added oomf from oats, pecans, and rice cereal. (Bonus: the oats and cereal mean you can eat them for breakfast.)

Butter, brown sugar, sugar, vanilla, eggs, flour, oats, chocolate chips, rice chex

## When life gives you lemons bars
$5/3

A fresh take on cranberry season. A vanilla cookie base with tangy sweetness from the two most perfect tart fruits: lemons and cranberries

Butter, sugar, vanilla, eggs, flour, lemon, cranberries

# Fall menu

## French 425
$9

You know I had to do it: this drink tastes like pie. This rich, velvety cocktail has it all: double-filtered brown butter-infused bourbon, pear cognac, spiced liqueuers, the nostalgia of pi days past.

**Brown butter bourbon, Belle de Brillet, St. George's spiced pear liqueur, St. Elizabeth's allspice dram, lemon, whiskey barrel aged bitters**

## Lipstick Memory
_Recipe by Christian Suzuki-Orellana, Kagano Popup_

$7

Speaking of pies, this tart and bitter Camapari number (dare we call it a spritz?) is the perfect pre-dinner drink to awaken your Thanksgiving appetite or palate cleanser to uplift you after the turkey hits.

**Sparkling wine, Campari, cran-rosemary juice**

## Aged Infinity Manhattan
$7 (limited quantity)

An _infinity bottle_ is fancy jungle juice. Leftovers from bottles are combined and aged for at least a month to create an unrepeatable and complex version Manhattan.

**3 ryes, 1 bourbon, Cocchi di Torino, gomme syrup**


## Anjou Mama
_Recipe by Jillian Vose, Death & Co_

$9

Juniper, which is front and center with the usual Tanqueray gin drinks you've seen before here, takes a backseat here with Santa Cruz's Venus No. 1 and Australia's Four Pillars. Strong yet fruity!

**Pear, Venus No. 1 gin, Four Pillars Navy Strength gin, lemon, orgeat, cinnamon syrup, honey syrup**

## Eye of the Torino
_Clarified milk punch adapted from a recipe by Jillian Vose, Death & Co_

$9

Give Laphroaig a second chance after my questionable first run of the Straw Dog. This unusual peated scotch x tiki pairing is softened by the clarifying process, during which milk is filtered out to create a clear cocktail that retains its creamy flavor.

**Laphroaig 10 scotch, Cocchi Vermouth di Torino, pineapple, lemon, orgeat, Coco Lopez, milk, Angostura & chocolate bitters**
