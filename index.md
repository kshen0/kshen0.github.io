# Fall menu

## French 425
$9

I wanted to make a drink that tastes like pie. This rich, velvety cocktail has it all: double-filtered brown butter-infused bourbon, pear cognac, spiced liqueuers, the nostalgia of pi days past.

**Brown butter bourbon, Belle de Brillet, St. Elizabeth's allspice dram, Lustau sherry vermut rojo, lemon, whiskey barrel aged bitters**

## Lipstick Memory
_Recipe by Christian Suzuki-Orellana, Kagano Popup_

$7

Speaking of pies, this tart and bitter Camapari number (dare we call it a spritz?) is the perfect pre-dinner drink to awaken your Thanksgiving appetite or palate cleanser to uplift you after the turkey hits.

**Sparkling wine, Campari, cran-rosemary juice**

## Aged Infinity Manhattan
$7 (limited quantity)

An _infinity bottle_ is fancy jungle juice. Leftovers from bottles are combined and aged for at least a month to create an unrepeatable cocktail (BYO Hawaiian punch)

**3 ryes, 1 bourbon, Cocchi di Torino, gomme syrup**


## Anjou Mama
_Recipe by Jillian Vose, Death & Co_

$9

Juniper, which is front and center with the usual Tanqueray gin drinks you've seen before here, takes a backseat here with Santa Cruz's Venus No. 1 and Australia's Four Pillars. Strong yet fruity!

**Pear, Venus No. 1 gin, Four Pillars Navy Strength gin, lemon, orgeat, cinnamon syrup, honey syrup**

## Eye of the Torino
_Clarified milk punch adapted from a recipe by Jillian Vose, Death & Co_

$9

Give Laphroaig a second chance after my questionable first run of the Straw Dog. This unusual peated scotch x tiki pairing is softened by the clarifying process, during which milk is filtered out to create a clear cocktail that retains its creamy flavor.

**Laphroaig 10 scotch, Cocchi Vermouth di Torino, pineapple, lemon, orgeat, Coco Lopez, milk, Angostura & chocolate bitters**
