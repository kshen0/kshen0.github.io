# A note on websites
I decided to take down my Squarespace site and will instead be rolling my own soon with the help of a designer friend. It seems I've finally bamboozled myself into taking on a web dev side project. In the meantime, enjoy this highly stylized Github page / Google forms combo.

# Fall menu

## Mexican Firing Squad
$5

Still avoiding large gatherings, but want to get drunk on tequila Halloween weekend for the cost of one surge-priced Uber? This is your drink.

**Reposado tequila, lime, fresh grenadine, Angostura bitters**

## Bourbon and Tepache
_Recipe by Bryan Eichhorst, Penca_

$9

Tepache is a Mexican fermented beverage made from pineapple and spices. Mine turned out a bit sweet, making this sweet and spiced cocktail a great Halloween treat or sipper for a cool night by the Netflix fire. 

**Elijah Craig small batch, tepache, Cocchi di Torino sweet vermouth, falernum, lemon, apple cider vinegar, Angostura bitters**

## Tepache
$3/5 oz (while supplies last)

If you just want the tepache (to drink on ice, in a cool Modelo, or to disintermediate the cocktail middleman)

## Fog Lights
_Recipe by Diego Pena_

$9

A wintery clarified milk punch inspired by a [London Fog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_fog_(beverage))

**Bourbon, Appleton Estate rum, Pierre Ferrand 1840 cognac, lemon, milk, Earl Gray syrup, vanilla**

## Anjou Mama
_Recipe by Jillian Vose, Death & Co_

$9

Juniper, which is front and center with the usual Tanqueray drinks you've seen before here, takes a backseat here with Venus No. 1 (local from Santa Cruz!) and Four Pillars. Strong yet fruity!

**Pear, Venus No. 1 gin, Four Pillars Navy Strength gin, lemon, orgeat, cinnamon syrup, honey syrup**

## Eye of the Torino
_Clarified milk punch adapted from a recipe by Jillian Vose, Death & Co_

$9

Give Laphroaig a second chance after my questionable first run of the Straw Dog. "The only balanced Laphroaig cocktail I've had" according to our focus groups.

**Laphroaig 10 scotch, Cocchi Vermouth di Torino, pineapple, lemon, orgeat, Coco Lopez, milk, Angostura & chocolate bitters**
