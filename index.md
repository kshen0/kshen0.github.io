# A note on websites
I decided to take down my Squarespace site and will instead be rolling my own soon with the help of a designer friend. It seems I've finally bamboozled myself into taking on a web dev side project. In the meantime, enjoy this highly stylized Github page / [Google forms](https://forms.gle/W6Tw2aot7FayZPTv6) combo.

# Fall menu

## Mexican Firing Squad
$6

Still avoiding large gatherings, but want to get drunk on tequila Halloween weekend for the cost of one surge-priced Uber? This is your drink.

Reposado tequila, lime, fresh grenadine, Angostura bitters

## Anjou Mama
_Recipe by Jillian Vose, Death & Co_
$9

Juniper, which is front and center with the usual Tanqueray drinks you've seen before here, takes a backseat here with Venus No. 1 (local from Santa Cruz!) and Four Pillars. Strong yet fruity!

Pear, Venus No. 1 gin, Four Pillars Navy Strength gin, lemon, orgeat, cinnamon syrup, honey syrup

## Eye of the Torino
_Clarified milk punch adapted from a recipe by Jillian Vose, Death & Co_
$9

Another clarified tiki-ish milk punch. Give Laphroaig a second chance after my questionable first run of the Straw Dog. "The only balanced Laphroaig cocktail I've had" according to our focus groups.

Laphroaig 10 scotch, Cocchi Vermouth di Torino, pineapple, lemon, orgeat, Coco Lopez, milk, Angostura & chocolate bitters

## Fog Lights Milk Punch
_Recipe by Diego Pena_
$9

A wintery milk punch inspired by a [London Fog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_fog_(beverage))

Bourbon, rum, cognac, lemon, milk, Earl Gray syrup, vanilla

As always,

* ✅ hand washing
* ✅ mask wearing
* ❌ taste sneaking
