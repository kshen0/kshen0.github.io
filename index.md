# Fall menu

## Four & Twenty
$9

I wanted to make a drink that tastes like pie. That's it, that's the drink.

Brown butter bourbon, Belle de Brillet pear cognac, St. Elizabeth's allspice dram, lemon, whiskey barrel aged bitters

## Aged Infinity Manhattan
$7 (limited quantity)

An _infinity bottle_ is fancy jungle juice. Leftovers from bottles are combined and aged for at least a month to create an unrepeatable cocktail - in this case, a Manhattan with Redwood Empire, Rittenhouse, and Wild Turkey rye, as well as Woodford Reserve bourbon, Cocchi di Torion, and gomme syrup.

**Rye, bourbon, Cocchi di Torino, gomme syrup**


## Anjou Mama
_Recipe by Jillian Vose, Death & Co_

$9

Juniper, which is front and center with the usual Tanqueray gin drinks you've seen before here, takes a backseat here with Santa Cruz's Venus No. 1 and Australia's Four Pillars. Strong yet fruity!

**Pear, Venus No. 1 gin, Four Pillars Navy Strength gin, lemon, orgeat, cinnamon syrup, honey syrup**

## Eye of the Torino
_Clarified milk punch adapted from a recipe by Jillian Vose, Death & Co_

$9

Give Laphroaig a second chance after my questionable first run of the Straw Dog. "The only balanced Laphroaig cocktail I've had" according to our focus groups.

**Laphroaig 10 scotch, Cocchi Vermouth di Torino, pineapple, lemon, orgeat, Coco Lopez, milk, Angostura & chocolate bitters**
