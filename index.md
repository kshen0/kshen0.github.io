## Aged Infinity Manhattan
$6 (limited quantity)

An _infinity bottle_ is fancy jungle juice. Leftovers from bottles are combined and aged for at least a month to create an unrepeatable cocktail - in this case, a Manhattan with Redwood Empire, Rittenhouse, and Wild Turkey rye, as well as Woodford Reserve bourbon, Cocchi di Torion, and gomme syrup.

**Rye, bourbon, Cocchi di Torino, gomme syrup**


## Anjou Mama
_Recipe by Jillian Vose, Death & Co_

$9

Juniper, which is front and center with the usual Tanqueray drinks you've seen before here, takes a backseat here with Venus No. 1 (local from Santa Cruz!) and Four Pillars. Strong yet fruity!

**Pear, Venus No. 1 gin, Four Pillars Navy Strength gin, lemon, orgeat, cinnamon syrup, honey syrup**

## Eye of the Torino
_Clarified milk punch adapted from a recipe by Jillian Vose, Death & Co_

$9

Give Laphroaig a second chance after my questionable first run of the Straw Dog. "The only balanced Laphroaig cocktail I've had" according to our focus groups.

**Laphroaig 10 scotch, Cocchi Vermouth di Torino, pineapple, lemon, orgeat, Coco Lopez, milk, Angostura & chocolate bitters**

# A note on websites
I decided to take down my Squarespace site and will instead be rolling my own soon with the help of a designer friend. It seems I've finally bamboozled myself into taking on a web dev side project. In the meantime, enjoy this highly stylized Github page / [Google forms](https://forms.gle/peefcFMMbvbA2bm98) combo.
